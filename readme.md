# Wattwatch

Please note that this is a playground for prompt engineering. I use this to try out prompt engineering and whats possible to do with LLMs. 

Wattwatch is a tool for monitoring and analyzing energy consumption in your home.

Note that this is not a production ready tool. It might not work as expected and may break at any time.
